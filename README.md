# pebble-ava

## a few words in advance

I never really intended to share this public, but the cloudpebble plattform seemed so unstable
and luckily had the posibility to push directly to GitHub so I took my chances and here we are ...

This was a universtiy project so feel free to do whatever with it - except for using it as solution for the 
same assignment (; - also check the credits for the graphics authors accreditation.

this whole things comes without any warranty and liability :P

## Credits

this is for a university assignment and just a back up of the cloud pebble project,

please note the the following - the code is free to use (I guess =P) 

tough the  dog sprite sheet is done by  [**Dawn**](https://community.playstarbound.com/members/dawn.3395/) 

the tiles used for the background are created by alucus who wants to be credited with a his nickname and deviant art link: https://alucus.deviantart.com/art/pallet-town-indoor-tiles-137116188
