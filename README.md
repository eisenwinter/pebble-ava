backup - wip - ignore

this is for a university assignment and just a back up of the cloud pebble project,
please note the the following - the code is free to use (I guess =P) tough the 
dog sprite sheet is done by **Dawn** https://community.playstarbound.com/members/dawn.3395/ 
and the tiles used for the background are created by alucus who wants to be credited with a his 
name and deviant art link https://alucus.deviantart.com/art/pallet-town-indoor-tiles-137116188
